# Consigner: Eco-Commerce Optimization Tool

This repository contains the source code for the Eco-Commerce Optimization Tool, developed during the HackXcelerate 2024 hackathon presented by Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology in collaboration with Microsoft and ByteXL. The tool aims to help e-commerce platforms optimize their operations and logistics to reduce environmental impact without sacrificing customer satisfaction.

## Project Details
### Problem Statement
Create an AI tool that helps e-commerce platforms optimize their operations and logistics to reduce environmental impact without sacrificing customer satisfaction.

### Prototype Overview
#### Key Features and Functionalities
- **ML-Based Packaging Optimization**: Determines optimal packaging size based on product dimensions and weight, minimizing waste.
- **AI Cargo Container Arrangement**: Optimizes goods placement considering container size, fragility, and delivery urgency.
- **Dynamic Vehicle Selection**: Chooses the best mode of transport based on delivery urgency and container filling time.
- **AR Product Suitability Assessment**: Allows customers to virtually try on clothing and visualize furniture in their homes before purchase.
- **Real-Time Route Optimization**: Generates optimal delivery routes for multiple vehicles based on distance matrix of delivery locations, vehicle capacity, and delivery demand, minimizing travel time and maximizing delivery efficiency.

### Innovation and Uniqueness
- **Package Optimization**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal packaging size based on product dimensions and weight, minimizing waste and maximizing space utilization.
- **Cargo Arrangement**: Employing AI-driven algorithms to optimize the arrangement of goods within cargo containers, considering factors such as container size, fragility of goods, and delivery urgency, ensuring efficient and safe transportation.
- **Carbon Footprint Transparency**: Customers can get visibility into the carbon footprint of their order through the platform's integration with the AI tool. This incentivizes sustainable purchasing behavior.

### Abstract
Consigner, the Next Gen E-Commerce Platform is a cutting-edge e-commerce platform utilizing machine learning for packaging optimization and augmented reality for immersive shopping experiences.
